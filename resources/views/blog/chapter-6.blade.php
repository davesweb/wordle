    <h1>Highscores and friends</h1>
    <p>
        Now that we have a more interesting Wordle game, which also keeps track of your score, it's time for highscores.
        What good is a score if you can't compare yourself to others? And if we can do that, why not challenge your
        friends and family to see if they can do better.
